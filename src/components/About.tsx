      Bhavish Nadar here, I am a creator not always in an artistic sense but in a more boring techy way. <br/><br/>
      When I found that the whole world pretty much runs on binary numbers firing here and there it sparked my curiosity to dive deep into it.<br/><br/>
      And so here I am finding, learning and creating new boring stuff which people call programming.<br/><br/>
      Other that that, I like to draw, listen to mostly jazz and watch dumb aggressive cats.
