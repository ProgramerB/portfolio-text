      I'm from mumbai, India, and on a pathway to become an aspiring communication designer. 
      <br/>One can say that my career started when I asked my mom, -“I wanna meet them” as I pointed at tom &
      jerry playing on the television, Her reply was -”they aren't real their are just cartoons, they are drawn and animated”.
      <br/>And this made me realise wait a minute, so I can just create them.
      <br/>thus bringing me to this moment in time. doing what i love -designing.
